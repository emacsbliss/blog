#+TITLE: Go to column in Emacs

I was looking for a command/function to jump to a specific column in emacs.
It turned out there is already one built in emacs: ~move-to-column~ and is bind to ~M-g Tab~.

Even better ~Evil~ has already defined a command ~evil-goto-column~ and
by default it's bind to ~|~.

So to jump to column 10 in evil normal mode, do this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
10 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

NOTE: column number is *0 based*
